# Identifying and Predicting Fraudulent Transactions in Financial Payment Service Data

We are leveraging simulated financial payment services data to build a predictive model capable of identifying fraudulent transactions.  Our methodology will encompass two key phases: conducting a comprehensive exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to uncover transaction patterns and anomalies, followed by implementing and evaluating a suite of machine learning algorithms to develop an accurate classification model.
